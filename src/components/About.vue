                    <p>
                        I am experienced in Vue.js and Nuxt.js in which I
                        produce high quality code for my clients that are both
                        well performing and well tested. I focus on solving
                        problems, not only technical problems but creating an
                        awesome experience for the users of my software both
                        visual and accessible. Mixing powerful tools and
                        knowledge about the users brings visual UI's to life and
                        leads to webpages being accessible and useful.
