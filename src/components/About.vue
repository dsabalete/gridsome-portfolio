                        I am experienced in Vue.js and Nuxt.js in which I
                        produce high quality code for my clients that are both
                        well performing and well tested. I focus on solving
                        problems, not only technical problems but creating an
                        awesome experience for the users of my software both
                        visual and accessible. Mixing powerful tools and
                        knowledge about the users brings visual UI's to life and
                        leads to webpages being accessible and useful.

                        I like to create websites for fun, trying out new
                        technologies and tools to improve myself as developer
                        and stay up to date with current tech.

                        Apart from being a frontend developer, I am a gym goer
                        and enjoy training with barbells and iron plates. I also
                        love watching ted talks and I also enjoy binge watching
                        films and series on Netflix (for improving my english
                        skills ðŸ˜‰).

                        And during the summer, I enjoy go camping with my family
                        near the sea.
